Class by A. Lazaric and M. Pirotta (FAIR, Paris).

### Assignment 1: Solving MDPs

Implementation and comparison between the policy iteration and value iteration RL algorithms on the Cliffwalk Gym environment.

### Assignment 2: Deep RL

Implementation and comparison of the following deep RL algorithms on the Cartpole Gym environment:

- Deep Q-Learning Network
- Double Deep Q-Learning Network
- Duelling Deep Q-Learning Network

See [Wang et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06581.pdf) (2016). 

### Assignment 3: Bandits

Implementation and comparison of the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm and the Kullbach-Leiber UCB algorithm on the Bernoulli bandits problem.

### Assignment 4: RL Meta-algorithm

Given a set of M base bandit algorithms, the aim to design a master algorithm which selects at each round which base algorithm to play. The goal is to ensure that the performance of the master is not far away from the best base algorithm had it been run separately. Implementation of the Regret Bound Balancing and Elimination Algorithm from [Pacchiano et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.13045.pdf) (2020).
